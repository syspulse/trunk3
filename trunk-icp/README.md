# ICP RPC

Supports old `Rosetta` and new `Ledger`

Only Blocks and Transactions are supported


## Notes

- Since Dfinity does not have a concept of Block, `trunk3` produces Blocks which with a single Transaction only for *compatability* with other entities.
- ICP does not have a concept of contract calls transactions, so RPC does not provide this information
